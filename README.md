# GOV.UK Prototype Kit Docs

This repository contains the code for the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit website](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/).

The code for the Prototype Kit can be found at [alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit).

## History of this repo

The Prototype Kit used to include its own documentation, and the Prototype Kit website was a deployed version of the Prototype Kit with specific flags set to always redirect to the documentation.

This repo was originally created in 2020 to spike a new documentation site based on the Design System website.

In June 2022 the documentation was removed from the Prototype Kit repo. At that point, the history of the `main` branch for this repo was rewritten to have the same history as the Prototype Kit repo, preserving the documentation so that it could be served from this repo instead.

The original history from the spike is preserved in the `from-govuk-design-system` branch.
