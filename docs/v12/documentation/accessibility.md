## Accessibility statement for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit website

This accessibility statement applies to the GOV.UK Prototype Kit documentation website at https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk

The GOV.UK Prototype team wants as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

The team has also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet has guidance on adjustments](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) you can make on your device to make it easier to use.
