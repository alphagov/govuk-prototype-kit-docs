>To create branching journeys, you need to know [how to use routes](create-routes).

Branching means that the user will only see the pages that are relevant to them.

For example, we can ask a question to check if the user is eligible for the service (say if they are over 18).

If the user is: 
- eligible, we can take them to the next question in the service 
- not eligible, we can take them to a different page to explain why (so they do not waste time answering more questions)
