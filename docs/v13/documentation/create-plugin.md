>To create a plugin, you need to understand how to [configure a plugin](./configure-plugin.md).

Plugins are a way to add extra components, styles, patterns and other features from the cross-government community. 

Anyone can create plugins for other users of the kit. They will be able to install and then use the features in their own designs to meet the specific needs of their users. 

For example, the HMRC Frontend plugin provides components like the [account header](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/account-header/) and [currency input](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/currency-input/). 

> We also have a guide on how to [install and use plugins](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/install-and-use-plugins).

A plugin can include:

* components
* styles (Sass and CSS)
* assets (for example images)
* page templates
* filters
* JavaScript
