Plugins are a way to add extra components, styles, patterns and other features from the cross-government community. 

Anyone can create plugins for other users of the kit, who can use the features in their own designs to meet their specific needs.

For example, the HMRC Frontend plugin provides components like the [account header](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/account-header/) and [currency input](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/currency-input/). 


A plugin can include:

* components
* styles (Sass and CSS)
* assets (for example images)
* page templates
* filters
* JavaScript

> We also have a guide on how to [install and use plugins](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/install-and-use-plugins).
