heading: Store your code online with GitHub and GitHub Desktop
---

GitHub is a way to store code online so you can collaborate with others. It also makes it easier to publish your prototype online using a hosting service.

Some concepts:

- Git - software that stores versions of your code
- GitHub - a website that shares your code online
- GitHub Desktop - an app that puts your code on GitHub (so that you can collaborate with others in your team)
- Repository/repo - a project stored in Git

## Set up GitHub Desktop

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

2. [Download the GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).

3. Run GitHub Desktop.

4. Sign in with your GitHub account details.

## Using GitHub Desktop

Use GitHub Desktop to work with repositories. 

A repository contains all of the files in a prototype. You can use the repository to view the file history and work on your prototype with others.

You can now:
* [store your new prototype in GitHub](./store-new-prototype)
* [download an existing prototype from GitHub](./use-existing-prototype)
