>To store your new prototype in GitHub, you need to [set up GitHub Desktop](github-desktop).



1. In GitHub Desktop, select **Add an Existing Repository** (if it's not on the screen, click the **File** menu and select **Add Local Repository**).

2. Click the **Choose** button and select your prototype folder.

### If Github Desktop shows a warning

You may get a warning, like this screenshot:

![Screenshot of the GitHub Desktop app. There is a separate pop-up box with the heading 'Add local repository'. In this box there is a text input labelled 'local path'. A button labelled 'choose'. A link titled 'Create a repository'. A button labelled 'Cancel'. And a button labelled 'Add repository'.](/public/docs/v13/images/docs/github-desktop-add-local-repository.png)

Do not worry if you get this warning - this is the correct process.

1. In the warning, click the **create a repository** link.

2. On the next screen, titled **Create a repository**, click the **Create repository** button.

## Upload your prototype to GitHub

1. In the top right, click **publish repository**

2. Make sure **'Keep this code private'** is not ticked, as we need others to be able to see and collaborate on it.

3. Click **publish repository**

Your prototype code is now on GitHub, which means other people can see and collaborate on your code.
