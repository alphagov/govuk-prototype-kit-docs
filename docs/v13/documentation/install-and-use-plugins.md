The Prototype Kit comes with most of the common GOV.UK components and design patterns built in ready to use.

Plugins provide you with extra components, styles and other features, provided by the wider community or an organisation’s design system.

## Installing plugins

1. In the terminal, start your prototype.

2. In your browser, go to the **Plugins** section of **Manage your prototype** (http://localhost:3000/manage-prototype).

You'll see 2 lists:

* plugins you have installed
* plugins that are available to install

You can install any plugins from the available list.

## Updating plugins

If there is a newer version of a plugin you’ve installed, you’ll see it on the Plugins page and can update it from there.
