The kit is designed to work with Node.js version 18.

### Check if you have Node.js

In the terminal, enter:
```
node --version
```
If it says `command not found` you do not have Node and will need to download and install it.

If the version number starts with 18 you have the correct version installed.

If it starts with another number you need to download and install version 18.

### Download and install Node.js

[Follow the Linux instructions on the Node.js. website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions). Make sure you get version 18.

### Once Node is installed

You’ll need to quit and restart the terminal to be able to use Node for the first time.

To check it's installed correctly you can again run:
```
node --version
```

If it’s installed correctly it should show a number starting with 18.
