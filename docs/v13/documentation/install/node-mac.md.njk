The kit is designed to work with Node.js version 18 and above.

### Check if you have Node.js

In the terminal, enter:
```
node --version
```
If it says `command not found` you do not have Node and will need to download and install it.

If the version number starts with 18 you have the correct version installed.

If it starts with a number lower than 18, you need to download and install version 18.

### Download and install Node.js

[Download version 18 from the Node.js website.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Run the installer with all default options.

### Once Node is installed

You’ll need to quit and restart the terminal to be able to use Node for the first time.

To check it's installed correctly you can again run:
```
node --version
```

If it’s installed correctly it should show a number starting with 18.
