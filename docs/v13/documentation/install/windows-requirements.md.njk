The GOV.UK Prototype Kit runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. At a minimum you’ll need a web browser and Node.js (install instructions below).

## Terminal for Windows

This guide will use `Git Bash` as a terminal instead of the existing `CMD` application. Git Bash is more fully featured and uses the same commands as Mac and Linux, so instructions in this guide work for all.

Installing `Git Bash` installs 2 things for you:

* a terminal (for entering commands) and
* Git (used later to share your work with others)

You'll need to use the terminal application to install, start and stop the kit. Using a terminal is sometimes called ‘using the command line’.

### Installing Git Bash for Windows users

Download [Git Bash (direct download)](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

When you install, on the screen **Choosing the default editor used by Git** select **Use Nano editor by default** (you may need to scroll the options to see it).

On all other screens, continue with the default options.

## Software you need

You'll usually need admin access to your machine to install the software.

If you do not have admin access, ask your IT team to install the software for you.

GDS staff can install the software themselves with the Self Service app.

You'll need a code editor. These two are popular, well established and fairly accessible:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows only)

You'll also need to [install Node.js](node-windows) (version 18.x.x).
