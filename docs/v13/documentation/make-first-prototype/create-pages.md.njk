You can create pages by using the templates that come with the Prototype Kit.

In your browser go to the **Manage your prototype** page: <a href="http://localhost:3000/manage-prototype" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/manage-prototype (opens in new tab)</a>. 

There is also a link to this page in the footer of your prototype.

In the navigation menu, go to the **Templates** section.

### Create a Start page

1. In the list of templates, find the **Start page** and select **Create**

2. Enter `/start` in **Path for the new page**

3. Select **Create page**


The kit creates a page from the template, in the `app/views` folder in your code editor.

#### Change the service name

You change the service name in the config file. This will change it on every page in your prototype.

1. In your code editor, go to the `app` folder and open the `config.json` file.

2. Change `serviceName` from **Service name goes here** to **Apply for a juggling licence**.

3. Press Cmd+S on Mac or Ctrl+S on Windows to save your change.

4. Refresh the page in your browser.

Youâ€™ll need to save every time you make a change to a file.

Usually your changes will automatically show in the browser without refreshing. We have made a change that applies to all pages in the prototype (called a config change), so you need to refresh the page.

You should see your service name change on the Start page.

### Question pages

1. In your browser, go to the **Templates** section of **Manage your prototype**  
<a href="http://localhost:3000/manage-prototype/templates" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/manage-prototype/templates (opens in a new tab)</a>

2. Create a page from the **Question page** template.

3. Enter the path `/juggling-balls`

4. Create another page from the **Question page** template.

5. Enter the path `/juggling-trick`

6. Go to the following URLs to check your pages:

- http://localhost:3000/juggling-balls 
- http://localhost:3000/juggling-trick 

7. Go to your code editor.

8. To create headings on a page we use heading tags, like `<h1>` for the page title, `<h2>` for a subheading and so on.

   In the `juggling-balls.html` file, change the text inside the `h1` tag from `Heading or question goes here` to `How many balls can you juggle?`

9. In the `juggling-trick.html` file, change the text inside the `h1` tag to `What is your most impressive juggling trick?`

### Check answers page

1. In your browser, create a page from the **Check answers** template.

2. Enter the path `/check-answers`

### Confirmation page

1. Create a page from the **Confirmation** template.

2. Enter the path `/confirmation`
