You can manage your prototype in 2 ways:

* through the **Manage your prototype** page
* in your text editor

In your text editor open your prototype folder. You will see the files and folders that you can edit in your prototype.

## Files and folders in your prototype

`/app` is for your work. Inside that folder:

  - `views` is for pages
  - `assets` is for CSS, JavaScript, images and downloadable files
  - `routes.js` is for advanced logic - for example, if a user should go to one page or another based on their answer
