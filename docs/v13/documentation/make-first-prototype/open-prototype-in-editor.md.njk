In your code editor open your prototype folder. You will see the files and folders that you can edit in your prototype.

## Files and folders in your prototype

`app` is the main folder that includes everything for your prototype. Inside that folder:
  - `assets` is where you can find CSS, JavaScript, images and downloadable files
  - `data` is for adding data files
  - `views` is where you can find all your pages
  - `config.js` is where you can change your service name
  - `routes.js` is for advanced logic - for example, if a user should go to one page or another based on their answer

You can learn more about these features after you finish building a basic prototype.
