The Prototype Kit stores answers that users enter. This means you can make more realistic prototypes, for example by showing answers for users to check.

## Show the answer to question 1

1. Open `check-answers.html` in your `app/views` folder
2. Find this code:
```
key: {
  text: "Question 1"
},
value: {
  text: "Answer 1"
}
```
3. Change it to:
```
key: {
  text: "Number of balls you can juggle"
},
value: {
  text: data['how-many-balls']
}
```

This is how we show data a user has entered – 'how-many-balls' is the `name` attribute from the `<input>` on the question page.

4. Update the screen reader text – change this
```
visuallyHiddenText: "Question 1"
```
to
```
visuallyHiddenText: "number of balls you can juggle"
```

Screen readers will read this out but it will not appear on the page. Without this hidden text, screen reader users would just hear “Change” and not know what it’s for.

## Show the answer to question 2

1. Find this code:
```
key: {
  text: "Question 2"
},
value: {
  text: "Answer 2"
}
```
2. Change it to:
```
key: {
  text: "Your most impressive juggling trick"
},
value: {
  text: data['most-impressive-trick']
}
```
3. Change
```
visuallyHiddenText: "Question 2"
```
to
```
visuallyHiddenText: "your most impressive juggling trick"
```
[Go to http://localhost:3000/start](http://localhost:3000/start) and answer the questions to check your answers show up correctly.

## Delete the remaining example row

On the ‘Check answers’ template page, there is a third example row you do not need.

Find and delete the last row **including the comma above it**

```
,
{
  key: {
    text: "Question 3"
  },
  value: {
    text: "Answer 3"
  },
  actions: {
    items: [
      {
        href: "#",
        text: "Change",
        visuallyHiddenText: "Question 3"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Your code should now look like this:

{% raw %}
```
  <div class="govuk-grid-row">
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds-from-desktop">

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">

      </h1>

      {{ govukSummaryList({
        rows: [
          {
            key: {
              text: "Number of balls you can juggle"
            },
            value: {
              text: data['how-many-balls']
            },
            actions: {
              items: [
                {
                  href: "#",
                  text: "Change",
                  visuallyHiddenText: "number of balls you can juggle"
                }
              ]
            }
          },
          {
            key: {
              text: "Your most impressive juggling trick"
            },
            value: {
              text: data['most-impressive-trick']
            },
            actions: {
              items: [
                {
                  href: "#",
                  text: "Change",
                  visuallyHiddenText: "your most impressive juggling trick"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }) }}
