title: Build a basic prototype
---

This tutorial shows you how to prototype a fictional 'Apply for a juggling licence' service that will:

- ask 2 questions
- show the user's answers for them to check
- show a confirmation page

It will take about an hour to finish this tutorial, after you install the Prototype Kit.

Our prototype will look a bit like this:

<figure>

![The first page has the title 'Start page' with the button 'Start now'. This is linked to a second page with the title 'Question 1' and a 'Continue' button. This forks to 2 different pages. 1 is titled 'Ineligible'. 2 is titled Question 2. Question 2 is linked to a page titled 'Check answers'. This links to page 6, titled 'Complete'.](/public/docs/v13/images/docs/tutorial-overview.png)

## Before you start

Before you start with the kit, find out what you need to [install and do](/docs/install/getting-started).

You'll also need a code editor. These two are popular, well established and fairly accessible:

 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
 - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) (Windows only)
