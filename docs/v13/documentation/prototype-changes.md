heading: Save and download changes using GitHub Desktop

When you store a prototype code on GitHub, other people can see and collaborate on your code.

Anyone can make changes on their device using a `branch` and publish it to the `main` version of the prototype (also called ‘pushing’ a change).

## Add and save changes
Create a branch. 

Open your repository in Github Desktop.

Select 'Current branch' and then 'New branch'

Enter a name for your branch

Create branch based on 'main'

## Download changes
When someone makes a change to the prototype, you’ll need update your version. You can `pull` these changes from Github Desktop or the Github repository.
