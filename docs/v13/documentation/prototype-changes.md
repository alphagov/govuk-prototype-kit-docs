heading: Save and download changes using GitHub Desktop

When you store a prototype code on GitHub, other people can see and collaborate on your code.

Anyone can make changes on their device using a `branch` and publish it to the `main` version of the prototype (also called ‘pushing’ a change).

## Create a branch

To make changes to your prototype, you need to create a branch from the repository.

1. In Github Desktop, select **Current branch** and **New branch**.
2. Enter a name and choose **Create branch based on 'main'**.

## Save and share changes

When you've made changes to your prototype and saved them in your code editor, you can share them by creating a 'pull request'.

4. Open Github Desktop. Enter a title and description, then select 'commit to branch-name'.
5. Publish branch - this publishes your code to Github.
6. Create a pull request - this tells others about the changes in your branch. They can collborate to review and make changes before merging them into the `main` (or `base`) branch.


## Download changes
When someone makes a change to the prototype, you’ll need update your version. You can `pull` these changes from Github Desktop or the Github repository.
