title: Publish your prototype online

We usually run the Prototype Kit on our own devices using localhost. If we want to share the prototype with others, we need to publish it online.  

Publishing your prototype online means you can:
 - share it with colleagues for collaboration
 - test it with users on their own devices

You'll need a hosting service to publish prototypes online.

## Hosting services

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit runs on any hosting service that supports Node.js.

Your organisation may already use a hosting service for the Prototype Kit. Check with your IT or digital team about which platform to use.

Some hosting services automatically publish every time you [push to GitHub](./github-desktop). For example:

 - [Railway](https://railway.app/new/github)
 - [Render](https://render.com/docs/github)
 - [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) (requires payment)

## Setting a password

When running the Prototype Kit online, you need to set a password. This is to stop anyone finding your prototype accidentally and mistaking it for a real service.

To set a password, you need to add 2 environment variables where the:
- `name` is `NODE_ENV`, and the `value` is `production`
- `name` is `PASSWORD`, and the `value` is whatever password you would like to use

If you are not sure how to add environment variables, check your hosting services documentation (it may have a slightly different name like `config vars` or `variables`).

Youâ€™ll also need to add another environment variable where the `name` is PASSWORD and the `value` is whatever password you want to use.

### If you get an error about username

Older versions of the Prototype Kit require a username - you can [migrate your prototype to version 13](./migrate-an-existing-prototype) or set a username.

Add another environment variable where the `name` is `USERNAME` and the `value` is whatever username you would like to use.
