heading: Work on an existing prototype
---

You can work together on an existing prototype. For example, with others in your team or if you're joining a team that already has a prototype.

## Clone the prototype

To work on an existing prototype, you'll need to clone the repository. 

1. Go to the prototype's repository on Github.
2. Select the **Code** button and choose an option to clone the repository. You can either Download a ZIP or open the repository with Github Desktop.

### Download a ZIP
In the terminal, navigate to the prototype folder and run `npm install`.

### Github Desktop
Open the prototype folder in your code editor. In the terminal, run `npm install`.

## Changes to the prototype

You can make changes on your device using a `branch` and publish it to the `main` version of the prototype (also called 'pushing' a change).

When someone makes a change to the prototype, you'll need update your version. You can `pull` these changes from Github Desktop or the Github repository.
