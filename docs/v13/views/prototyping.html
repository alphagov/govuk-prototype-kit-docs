     <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Prototyping</h1>

<p>
  A prototype is an early version of a service that allows the team to test and explore ideas before developing them. They allow you to share ideas with users early and often, so that you can find issues with the design and make improvements based on user research.
</p>

<p>
  Prototyping is important because it:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>helps you to make sure you're building the right service for your users</li>
    <li>email address and business contact details</li>
    <li>helps your whole team to get a shared understanding about the future of your service</li>
    <li>allows your team to explore design ideas much faster and at lower risk than using your production code</li>
  </ul>
 
<p>
  There are different types of prototypes that you should use at different stages of your design - from sketches to code prototypes using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.  
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use prototypes</h2>

<p>You must use prototypes in the Alpha phase of your project to explore and test different approaches to the design of the service.</p>
<p>
  Continue to use prototypes in the Beta and Live stages to explore potential new features or improvements.
  </p>


  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Types of prototype</h2>

<p>Prototypes can vary in style from a quick pen and paper sketch to a code prototype that works like a fully interactive website.</p>
<p>
  The main types of prototype are:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2014/05/22/gov-uk-sketching-templates/">sketches</a> - explore and discuss basic ideas with colleagues</li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/resources-and-tools/">flow diagrams</a> - show how a user navigates through a service based on their answers (only share with colleagues)</li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/resources-and-tools/#create-prototypes-and-wireframes">wireframes</a> - visualise an early idea and get feedback from colleagues or users</li>
  <li><a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/">code</a> - show or test a realistic version of your service that looks and behaves like GOV.UK (best for user research)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You should use the type of prototype that best meets your needs at the time.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we use code prototypes</h2>
<p>
  Code prototypes are the best approach if you want to test realistic interactions that a user has with your service. 
</p>
<p>
The GOV.UK Prototype Kit lets you build realistic code prototypes of your service that look and behave like GOV.UK. 
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Advantages of prototyping in code</h2>

<p>
The advantages of building prototypes in code are that you can:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>copy code from the GOV.UK Design System to add components, styles and patterns</li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/">learn from the research and experience of other service teams across government</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Advantages of prototypes built in code</h2>

<p>The advantages of prototypes built in code are that:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>you can show different pages based on a user’s answers (called '<a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/">branching</a>') to test how users respond to your content and what happens in the flow if they get a question wrong
  </li>
  <li>you can share them by publishing on the web</li>
  <li>they look and behave almost exactly like the real thing, on mobile as well as desktop</li>
  <li>it helps you design within the constraints of the web</li>
  <li>it's easier for the whole team to have a shared understanding of design ideas, flows and behaviours</li>
  <li>it supports common tools like Git and GitHub for collaboration and project history</li>
  <li>you can use plugins, for example from department design systems, to add more components, styles and patterns</li>
</ul> 

<p>
  The code in a prototype does not need to meet the same standards as production code. For example, it does not need to be secure or to perform well with large volumes of traffic.
</p>
<p>When you do move into production you need to make sure any code you use is good quality so you may not be able to use the same code. Do not just copy prototype code into production.
</p>
<p>The point is to test ideas as quickly as possible. If an idea tests well, you may want to work with a developer to make your code a bit clearer so that it’s easier for others to work with.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing code prototypes</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Publishing on the web</h3>

<p>You can share code prototypes by publishing them on the web.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK Prototype Kit includes instructions for <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku">publishing prototypes</a> using a service called Heroku.</p>

<p>When you've uploaded your prototype, you can easily share it with others. You must protect access to your prototype with a password so that members of the public do not find it and mistake it for a real service.</p>

<p>You must not use the GOV.UK Prototype Kit to make live services. It's designed for prototyping and does not have the security or performance features needed for a live service.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Using code collaboration software</h3>
<p>Multiple people can collaborate on the same prototype using software called Git. The GOV.UK Prototype Kit has guidance on <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/setting-up-git">how to set up Git for your prototypes</a>.</p>
