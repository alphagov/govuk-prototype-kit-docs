   <p>The GOV.UK Prototype Kit is provided by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Service</a> (GDS), which is part of the Cabinet Office. The data controller for GDS is the Cabinet Office — a data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed. </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053">Read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register for more information</a>.
    </p>
   
   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What data we collect from you</h2>
   
    <p>We collect certain information and data about you when you use the <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a>. </p>
    
    <p>We collect your user profile if you interact with us on collaboration tools and platforms</p>
    
    <p>If you sign up to our mailing list, we’ll collect your:</p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>name</li>
      <li>email address and business contact details</li>
    </ul>
   
   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why we need your data</h2>
   
   <p>For a number of the activities that we undertake to complete our function, we need to process personal data. We collect certain personal data when you use the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.</p>
    <p>We collect your data so that we can:</p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>tell you about work and updates on the Prototype Kit</li>
      <li> work with you on contributions, where you’ve proposed to add or improve part of the Prototype Kit</li>
      <li>support you, including both the provision of support and responses to user enquiries</li>
      <li>gather feedback, including gathering it to improve our services, and responding to it, if you have asked us to</li>
      <li>invite you to take part in user research</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Our legal basis for processing your data</h2>
  
  <p>The legal basis for processing this data is that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. This is because the GOV.UK Prototype Kit brings together research, design and development from across government to make sure it’s representative and relevant for its users.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for sending you updates through our mailing list is consent.</p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How long we keep your data</h2>
    
    <p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as:</p>
   
   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the law requires us to</li>
      <li>we need for the purposes listed above</li>
    </ul>
  
  <p>This means that we will only hold your personal data for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 7 years.</p>
  
  <p>If you have signed up to our mailing list, your email address will only be retained while you choose to remain on the list. At regular intervals we will draw your attention to your right to unsubscribe.</p>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>
  
  <p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>
  
  <p>Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while being processed by GDS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the United Kingdom.</p>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Providers we use</h2>
  
  <p>As part of GOV.UK Prototype Kit we share your personal data with data processors who provide us with:</p>
  
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>software collaboration platforms when you share research, feedback or make a contribution</li>
      <li>mailing list providers when you sign up to receive emails from us</li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-service-user-support-privacy-notice/user-support-privacy-notice">support providers</a> when you contact us for assistance
      </li>
      <li>web analytics services</li>
    </ul>
   
   <p>We share a mailing list provider with the GOV.UK Design System. This means your data is part of the same system as the GOV.UK Design System mailing list.</p>

   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>
   
   <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure.
