If youâ€™ve installed the Prototype Kit before, or you're comfortable using Git
and a terminal, you might want to use the [quick start guide](/get-started/quick-start-guide).

The Prototype Kit works on Mac, Windows and Linux.

It usually takes about 15 minutes to install. Steps vary slightly depending on
which operating system you're using.
