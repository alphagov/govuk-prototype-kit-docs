This guide explains how to start and stop the Prototype Kit on Mac, after you’ve installed it.

> If you have not already installed the Prototype Kit, [go to the beginning of the installation guide](/get-started/mac-before-you-install).

Open Terminal and go to your prototype folder by entering `cd ~/projects/` followed by the name of your prototype, like this.

`cd ~/projects/name-of-your-prototype`

To start running the Prototype Kit, enter `npm start`.

At this point, you might see a message asking if you give permission to share anonymous data about how you use the Prototype Kit, to help the team improve it.

![Terminal showing a message asking for permission to share anonymous usage data to help the team improve the service.](../share-usage-data.png)

Enter `y` for yes or `n` for no.

After a few seconds, Terminal should give you a message that says “Listening on port 3000 url: <span>ht</span>tp://localhost:3000”. This tells you the Prototype Kit is running successfully.

## Preview your prototype

Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000 (opens in a new tab)</a> in your web browser.

You should see the index page for your prototype.

This means your prototype is successfully running.

## Edit your prototype

You need to open your prototype in your code editor to be able to make changes to it.

Open up your code editor, select the option to open a project or file and navigate to your prototype folder to open it.

Once you've opened your prototype folder you should be able to see a list of all the folders and files it contains.

## Stop the Prototype Kit

It’s fine to leave the Prototype Kit running for days or while your computer is asleep. If and when you want to stop it running, just press the ctrl and c keys together in Terminal.

{# ## Start prototyping

Once you have successfully installed and run the Prototype Kit, you are ready to start prototyping. To help with this you can:

- read guides about [how to make a prototype](/docs/guides)
- take a [step by step tutorial to learn how to make a prototype]()
- find coded examples to use in your prototype in the <br>[GOV.UK Design System](https://kit_docs_prototype--govuk-design-system-preview.netlify.com/) #}
