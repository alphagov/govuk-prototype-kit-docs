You can route users from your service's index page to your start page. The index page is the page that loads when users visit http://localhost:3000.

1. Open the `index.html` file in your `app/views` folder.
2. Add an `<a>` tag that links to `/start`.

You can now find out how to [publish your prototype online](/guides/publishing-on-heroku) to share it with your team or do user research
