If you do research with real user data, you must [open a new incognito window](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464) for each research session, and close all windows before the next session.

## Showing data

To display user data on a different page, use this [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) code:

```
{%raw%}
{{ data['INPUT-ATTRIBUTE-NAME'] }}
{%endraw%}
```

Change `INPUT-ATTRIBUTE-NAME` to the value you used in the [`name` attribute on the question page](/get-started/make-your-first-prototype-add-questions#add-a-text-input-to-question-2). For example:

```
{%raw%}
{{ data['number-of-balls'] }}
{%endraw%}
```

### Show the answer to question 1

1. Open the `check-your-answers.html` file in your `app/views` folder.
2. Find the `<dt>` tag that contains the text `Name`.
3. Change `Name` to `Number of balls you can juggle`.
4. In the `<dd>` tag on the next line, change `Sarah Philips` to `{%raw%}{{ data['how-many-balls'] }}{%endraw%}`.

You must also change `<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> name</span>` to `<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> number of balls you can juggle</span>`.

Screen readers will read the text in the `<span>` tags, but the text will not appear on the page.

### Show the answer to question 2

1. Find the `<dt>` tag that contains the text `Date of birth`.
2. Change `Date of birth` to `Your most impressive juggling trick`.
3. In the `<dd>` tag on the next line, change `5 January 1978` to `{%raw%}{{ data['most-impressive-trick'] }}{%endraw%}`.

You must also change `<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> date of birth</span>` to `<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> your most impressive juggling trick</span>`.

Go to http://localhost:3000/start and answer the questions to check the answer to question 2 works.
